## Project Goals

Our goal is to create an interactive data story about police fatality records in the United States. The Washington Post and the Guardian maintain detailed records describing altercations between civilians and police that result in civilian fatalities caused by police. We will use this data to both visualize aggregate information about these fatalities and incorporate narrative elements to tell the stories of victims. We will also be pulling in notable events to provide context for patterns illustrated by the data. Our final product is a blend of these elements.

While many would say they’ve heard of individual events of police brutality in recent history, few would say they have a holistic sense of recent legislation around police brutality and how it relates to things they’ve heard in the news. Envisioned users of our application include citizens, researchers, and others interested in fleshing out what they know about the state of police fatalities in the U.S. In building our data story, we too would like to learn more about police fatalities, challenge our assumptions and discover insights that we can share with others.
