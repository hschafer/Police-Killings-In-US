            Some argue that there isn't a systematic bias in the police force because nearly 50% of the
            victims shot by police officers are white.

          Both sides of an interaction with the police need to be held accountable for their actions. In many court cases revolving around complaints against police officers, the main evidence in the case is based on the conflicting accounts of the partipants.
          Body cameras have been shown by a <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/use-of-body-worn-cameras-sees-complaints-against-police-virtually-vanish-study-finds">Cambridge study</a> to reduce complaints against police officers by 93%. Some hope that funding body cameras by police officers will lead to fewer deadly conflicts with civilians.

One of these is <a href="https://www.joincampaignzero.org/">Campaign Zero</a>, which lays out ten focus areas for policy changes aimed at reducing police killings to zero. Examples of these focus areas in this campaign include <a href="https://www.joincampaignzero.org/representation">requiring regular surveys from the community about police satisfaction</a>, <a href="https://www.joincampaignzero.org/investigations">requiring independent investigations of every incident where civilians are seriously injured</a>, and <a href="https://cse442-17s.github.io/Police-Killings-In-US/prototype/">taking misconduct settlements from police department budgets rather than city budgets</a>.

          Design Rationale
          <p class="section3Subtitle">Motivation</p>
          <p class="sectionText">
            Our overall project goal is to visualize aggregate information about police killings and to tell the stories
            of the victims. For our prototype we aim to allow users to see that this trend of police killings is
            apparent throughout the country, while also displaying information about individual victims. To do this, we
            chose to create a map visualization showing of the number of police killings in each city, and the name each
            victim. We display victim information on a city level because the amount of data countrywide would be
            overwhelming to look at simultaneously. To show the possible interactions with the visualization, it
            randomly highlights specific cities when the user is not actively engaged with the map.
          </p>
          <p class="section3Subtitle">Tooltips</p>
          <p class="sectionText">
            Once we chose to use a map, we decided to include tooltips for each city to allow for deeper exploration of
            the dataset. Initially, the tooltips included both the city name and the list of victim names. This required
            the user to scroll through the list of names for cities with more police killings. This UI was difficult to
            use and obscured many of the names behind scrolling, defeating our primary purpose of highlighting each
            victim. Because of this, we moved the list of names to the side of the map. We display the city name both on
            the side of the map and on the tooltip to ensure the connection between the map and the names would be
            apparent.
          </p>
          <p class="section3Subtitle">Zoom</p>
          <p class="sectionText">
            Zooming is a very important feature for map visualizations in general. It is effective at allowing users to
            drill down to see more specific information, and users have come to expect the ability to zoom in. We
            initially just implemented scroll zoom and click-to-zoom. We decided to have both of these features because
            they serve slighty different purposes. Click-to-zoom allows users who are interested in a specific state to
            easily get an optimized state view. Scroll zoom is best for users who want to freely explore the data or
            want to zoom in on a very specific area. We later added the zoom buttons to assist users who may not be
            comfortable with scroll zoom.
          </p>
          <p class="section3Subtitle">Bubbles</p>
          <p class="sectionText">
            We use the area of bubbles to represent the number of people killed by police in each city. It is important
            that users can see every city that has an incident and can generally compare the number of incidents per
            city, and an area encoding fulfills this purpose. We briefly considered using color rather than size to
            encode the number of victims, but we wanted to avoid the complex connotations that come with different color
            schemes. We included a key for the different sizes of bubbles to make it easier to discern specific values.

            In total, this application took us about 35 - 40 hours of work. The aspects that took the most time are
            getting the map to show up correctly initially, getting the bubbles to show on the city locations initially,
            and finalizing the details for zooming. The early work on the map took a long time because we were still
            getting comfortable with D3, and we had some trouble with the relationship between the map and the bubbles.

          <p class="sectionText">
            In our final project we hope to address the issue that our prototype has with very dense areas of the map.
            Most of the map is easy to read, but areas of many nearby cities with police killings are difficult to
            discern. One example of this is the area around LA. To address this, we adjusted the size of the bubbles and
            subtly outlined them to make them more distinct. We also ordered the bubbles by size so the smaller ones can
            still be hovered over. Still, this does not fully address the problem. This prototype is an overview of who
            the victims are, and will be just one page in our final visualization. Our final data story will add a
            narrative to this dataset by highlighting specific victims' stories and including information about recent
            legislation.
