                                Our overall project goal is to visualize aggregate information about police killings and to tell the stories of victims.  For our prototype we aim to allow users to see that this trend of police killings is apparent throughout the country, while also displaying information about individual victims.  To do this, we chose to create a map visualization showing of the number of police killings in each city, and the names each victim.  We display victim information on a city level because the amount of data would be overwhelming to look at simultaneously.  To encourage more exploration of the data, our visualization randomly highlights specific cities when the user is not mousing over the map.

                            <p class="section3Subtitle">Tooltips</p>
                            <p class="section3Text">
                                Once we chose to create a map, we decided to include tooltips for each city to  allow for deeper exploration of the dataset.  Initially, the tooltips included both the city name and the list of victim names.  This required the user to scroll through the list of names for cities with more police killings.  This UI was difficult to use and obscured many of the names behind scrolling, defeating our primary purpose of highlighting each victim.  Because of this, we moved the list of names to the side of the map.  We display the city name on the side of the map and on the tooltip to ensure the connection between the map and the names is apparent.

                            <p class="section3Text">
                                Zooming is a very important feature for map visualizations in general.  It is effective at allowing users to drill down to show more specific information, and users have come to expect the ability to zoom in.  We initially just implemented scroll zoom and click-to-zoom.  We decided to have both of these features because they serve slighty different purposes.  Click-to-zoom allows users who are interested in specific states to easily get an optimized state view.  Scroll zoom is best for users who want to freely explore the data or want to zoom in on a very specific area.  We later added the zoom buttons to assist users who may not be comfortable with scroll zoom.

                            <p class="section4Text">In general, we discussed the motivation and design of our visualization.  We collaborated to decide which interactions to support, and to prioritize certain aspects of our data.

                                <li>Meredith Lampe: Initial map setup, changing the tooltips to only include the city name, moving the list of victims to the right side of the page, adding descriptive text to the map, fixing tooltips to make them easier to hover over</li>
                                <li>Nick Mooney: Setup the project framework and tools, making github page, sizing bubbles correctly when zooming, stop the page from scrolling down when zoomed out completely</li>
                                <li>Hunter Schafer: Overall page layout, initial scroll zoom, click to zoom, migrating files from our temporary github project, processing data to extract desired features, mapping data to bubbles on the map, center the map when zoomed out completely, title page, random selection of cities</li>
                                <li>Erika Wolfe: Preliminary zooming, initial tooltips including the ability to scroll through the list of victim names, saving condensed data to remove javascript processing, write and organize write-up</li>

                                In total, this application took us about 35 - 40 hours of work.  The aspects that took the most time are getting the map to show up correctly initially, getting the bubbles to show on the city locations initially, and finalizing the details for zooming.  The early work on the map took a long time because we were still getting comfortable with D3, and we had some trouble with the relationship between the map and the bubbles.

                                In our final project we hope to address the issue that our prototype has with very dense areas of the map.  Most of the map is easy to read, but areas of many nearby cities with police killings are difficult to discern.  One example of this is the area around LA.  To address this, we adjusted the size of the bubbles and subtly outlined them to make them more distinct.  We also ordered the bubbles by size so the smaller ones can still be hovered over.  Still, this does not fully address the problem.
